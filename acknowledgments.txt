I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the entire IDDI team for giving me the opportunity to work in such an important and fascinating field as clinical trials.

I am truly thankful for the knowledge and skills I have acquired during my time with this remarkable team.

I would like to give special thanks to Davy Bale, Beno√Æt De Malglaive, and Nicolas Deravet, whose valuable feedback and insightful advice guided me throughout my internship.

Finally, I sincerely thank Dominique Henderickx and Lara Sanir for ensuring that my integration into the IDDI team went smoothly and for their constant support.
